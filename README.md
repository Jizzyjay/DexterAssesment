- Frontend engineer assessment

- Javascript & React framework

- You are tasked with creating a dashboard page according to the specifications
outlined in the provided Figma link.
- Within the dashboard, there is a “user” section, where you are expected to
display the total number of users in the API links provided in the document.
- Upon clicking on the “user” section, we expect to see a table displaying user
information, including their name and email.
- There should be a filter option on the user page where we can see (incomplete
registered users). Incomplete registered users are users in the user object where
the fields “shop” and "business” are “null” in the API response. (Go creative here
